# Home Assignment: Todo List Application

## Objective  
Develop a full stack Todo List application using the provided backend code for authentication. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete todo items.

## Technologies
- **Backend:** Express.js (authentication code provided)
- **Frontend:** React.js (architecture is flexible)

## Requirements

### 1. Authentication:
   - Implement user authentication using the provided backend code.
   - Ensure secure login and registration processes.
   - Use JWT or session-based authentication as per the provided backend architecture.

### 2. Todo List Features:
   - **CRUD Operations:** 
     - Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete their todo items.
   - **Todo Item Structure:**
     - Each todo item should have at least the following properties:
       - Title (string)
       - Description (string)
       - Status (boolean: completed or not)
       - Due Date (date)
   - **User-specific Todos:**
     - Ensure that each user can only manage their own todo items.

### 3. Frontend Requirements:
   - Use React.js for the frontend.
   - Implement a clean and user-friendly interface.
   - Ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.
   - Use state management (e.g., Context API, Redux) to manage application state.
   - Include validation for user inputs.

### 4. Additional Features (Optional):
   - Implement sorting and filtering options for the todo list.
   - Add user notifications for actions (e.g., todo added, updated, deleted).
   - Provide a dark mode toggle.

### 5. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for critical components and functions.
   - Ensure the application is free of critical bugs.

### 6. Documentation:
   - Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application.
   - Include comments in the code to explain key functionalities.

### 7. Submission Guidelines:
   - Submit the code repository (e.g., GitHub) with a clear commit history.
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to run the application.
   - Provide a demo link if hosted online.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization.
- Functionality and adherence to requirements.
- User interface design and user experience.
- Testing coverage and documentation.
